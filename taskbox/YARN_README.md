# Component Library Yarn and Storybook Setup

A responsive React component library built with TypeScript, Styled Components, and Storybook.

View component and test documentation here: [Documentation](https://docs.vaughnws.ca/books)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Yarn package manager

### Installation

```bash
cd taskbox
yarn install
```

### Development

Start Storybook development server:

```bash
yarn storybook
```

This will open Storybook at `http://localhost:8083` where you can view and interact with all components.

### Testing

Run all tests:

```bash
yarn test
```

Run tests with UI:

```bash
yarn test:ui
```

Generate coverage report:

```bash
yarn test:coverage
```

### Build

Build the Storybook static site:

```bash
yarn build-storybook
```

## Development

### Adding a New Component

1. Create a new folder in `src/components/`
2. Create the following files:
   - `ComponentName.types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces
   - `ComponentName.tsx` - Component implementation
   - `ComponentName.stories.tsx` - Storybook stories
   - `ComponentName.test.tsx` - Unit tests
   - `index.ts` - Exports

3. Export the component from `src/components/index.ts`

### Component Requirements

- Must support `disabled` state
- Must support `backgroundColor` and `color` props
- Must be responsive
- Must have at least 2 tests
- Must have Storybook stories with controls
- Must follow TypeScript strict mode

## Quick start

1.  **Create the application.**

    Use [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) to get this template.

    ```shell
    # Clone the template
    npx degit chromaui/intro-storybook-react-template taskbox
    ```

1.  **Install the dependencies.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and install the necessary dependencies.

    ```shell
    # Navigate to the directory
    cd taskbox/

    # Install the dependencies
    yarn
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Open the `taskbox` directory in your code editor of choice and building your first component!

1.  **Browse your stories!**

    Run `yarn storybook` to see your component's stories at `http://localhost:8083`

1.  **`.storybook`**: This directory contains Storybook's [configuration](https://storybook.js.org/docs/configure) files.

2.  **`.yarn`**: This directory contains the configuration files for Yarn including the cache and the global packages.

3.  **`node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages).

4.  **`public`**: This directory will contain the development and production build of the site.

5.  **`src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on your application.

6.  **`eslintrc.cjs`**: This file is the configuration file for [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).

7.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track or maintain during the development process of your project.

8.  **`.yarnrc.yml`**: This file contains the configuration for Yarn. It's used to define the project's settings, such as caching and other settings.

9.  **`index.html`**: This is the HTML page that is served when generating a development or production build.

10. **`LICENSE`**: The template is licensed under the MIT licence.

11. **`package.json`**: Standard manifest file for Node.js projects, which typically includes project specific metadata (such as the project's name, the author among other information). It's based on this file that npm will know which packages are necessary to the project.

12. **`tsconfig.app.json`**: This file contains the TypeScript compiler options for the project.

13. **`tsconfig.json`**: This file is the root TypeScript configuration file that specifies the root files and the compiler options required to compile the project.

14. **`tsconfig.json`**: This file is the root TypeScript configuration file that specifies the root files and the compiler options that could be extended by other configuration files in the project.

15. **`tsconfig.node.json`**: This file contains the TypeScript compiler options required to manage the Node.js environment in the project configuration files. Used to help distinguish between configurations for different parts of the project.

16. **`vite.config.ts`**: This is the configuration file for [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.

17. **`vitest.shims.d.ts`**: This file contains TypeScript type definitions and shims that ensure proper type support for Vitest when integrated with Storybook's test addon. It provides necessary global types and resolves compatibility issues between the testing frameworks.

18. **`yarn.lock`**: This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(Do not change it manually).**

19. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about the project.
